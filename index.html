				<p>Thanks for coming to my site! I'm a programmer with interest in game dev, optimization, and hardware/software interfacing.</p>
				<p>I started programming when I was a freshman in High School when I took a Visual Basic/C# class. I had loved computers and computer games since I was a kid, so learning programming was the natural progression of my interests.
				I continued through all of the programming courses my School Offered, and it wasn't long before I decided that Computer Science and programming was my passion. I loved the freedom, utility, and opportunity presented by the medium.
				Since College, I've participated in quite a few Hackathons and Game Jams, working with my friends on various projects that interested us. </p>
				<p> Also, I have a really cool cat, named Albert.</p>
