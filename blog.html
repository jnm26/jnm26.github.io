				<h2>So what's an Undertow anyway? - 4/30/17</h2>
				<h3>un·der·tow</h3>
				<p>another term for rip current, used in the incorrect belief that rip currents drag swimmers below the surface.</p>
				<p>an implicit quality, emotion, or influence underlying the superficial aspects of something and leaving a particular impression.</p>
				<p>Undertow is a game I've been thinking of making since around 2013. The whole idea actually came from one of the powers in the game BioShock: Infinite (which unfortunately ended up dissapointing me as a game). 
				It's a 2D game which focuses on player movement, and having a wide array of options to approach any given situation, primarily using water-based abilities.
